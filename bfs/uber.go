/*
We are given a list of entries which has information about employees in an organization.
The format of each entry is as follows.

employeeId, firstName, lastName, managerId

Here is a sample of the inputs.
Example:
1, Rob, Choi, 2
2, Jennifer, Grant
3, Andy, Zuckerman, 1
4, Mark, Oâ€™Donnell, 1

Notes:
Each employee only reports to one manager
If an employee does not have a managerId, that employee is the head of the organization

We want to print the hierarchy of the organization in a readable format as shown below in a sample.
Output
Jennifer Grant
 	Rob Choi
 		Andy Zuckerman
 		Mark O'Donnell
